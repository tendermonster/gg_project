### Paperwork

This code was base for the work: A Game Theoretic Approach for Cost-Effective Management of Energy Harvesting Smart Grids

This project attempts to simulate smart grid and use game theoretical methodology to transact energy on a behalf of the prosumer.

Feel free to experiment with the code or implement some new models for transaction and maybe even make a pull request :)
